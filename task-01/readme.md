## First Challenge
Found x=6 (A perfect number is a number whose sum of divisors excluding itself returns the number itself) and y=5 (2x-7). 
## Second Challenge
Now this one threw me for a bit of a loop, the answer to which element was first used to make semiconductors is suprisingly complicated. My 
initial google query: **"first element used to make semiconductors"** found me this [paper](https://djena.engineering.cornell.edu/hws/history_of_semiconductors.pdf) 
from Cornell University which claims that the [Crystal Detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_detector) made by [G.W Pickard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenleaf_Whittier_Pickard)
 in 1906 was the first semiconductor device, this device uses silicon (atomic number 14). However this answer felt quite complicated so i tried rephrasing my google query 
to **"which element was first used to make semiconductors"** and it now immediately replied with Germanium (atomic no 32) which actually only came into use around 40 years after silicon.

However, for the sake of correctness, i shall be using Germanium but i think this is a great example of how the top result of google isnt always correct.
## Third Challenge
Binging all the Harry Potter movies finally paid off lol, i remembered the scene where Harry faced a creature that showed his greatest fear, i searched for the clip in youtube and found the creature's name and its weakness. I also did not know that you could use `git checkout` to quickly copy a file from another branch like that, so that was interesting.
# Fourth Challenge
This one was fairly straightforward, x=7 and y=4 (FOUR). The spell was present in the graveyard branch
