## Self-Introduction
Hello Everyone! Hridesh MG here, currently pursuing CSE at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I'm just your run of the mill guy who has a passion for programming. 
## Why Should You Choose Me?
I believe that one of my most significant strengths is my ability to adapt new situations, I love to push myself out of my comfort zone in an attempt to better myself as a person. Joining Amritapuri was one such decision I made and  do not think I would have taken said decision if clubs like amFOSS and bi0s were not present here. 

I'm ready to give my all for this club so that, when I graduate I can look back and be proud of how far I've come. I genuinely love programming, and nothing gives me more satisfaction than designing, prototyping and creating an app from scratch.
## How Will You Contribute Back To The Club?
Apart from coding, one of my favourite activities to do is teach others. Once I get some solid experience, I would love to take on a more mentor type role, in the meantime, I would be more than ready to help wherever I can for the betterment of the club, be it in the form of projects or events.
## What Are Your Goals For The Next 6 Months?
I wish to work on some truly big projects, since i've got a solid understanding of how to create small apps and scripts now, I wish to try and contribute to some open source projects. I will try and accomplish this by picking a few projects which interest me on github, start understanding the codebase, solve existing issues and then work my way towards adding new features, becoming a better developer in the process.

Apart from that, I want to expand my network and meet passionate developers both offline and online, I believe that creating a reputation in FOSS communities is a good way to do this.
## Praveshan Process Feedback
Praveshan was the most well-thought-out and executed recruitment process that I've seen in my life, everything from the creative task briefs to the use of Discord was just perfect and I have no complaints or feedback to offer in that regard.
