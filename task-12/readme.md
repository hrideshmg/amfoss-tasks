# Godot
This was a really fun task to work on, becoming a game developer was once my ambition and its the reason I  picked up programming, so it was nice to go back to my roots. It was my first time using Godot and i found the whole experience quite pleasant, the signal system in particular, stood out to me and I made great use of it for the project. Its impresive how far an open source engine like Godot can take you in the realm of game development.
