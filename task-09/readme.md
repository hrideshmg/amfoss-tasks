This was my first time creating an app in a cross platform framework like flutter, it was quite a worthwhile experience, i faced a lot of difficulty getting started because of the osm documentation not hosting working examples but eventually i got the hang of it. 

It feels nice to know that i can know create an android app from scratch now, since an android app is something ive never created before. Ive included an apk for the app in the release folder.
