This task was quite informative, frankly it kind of surprised me for some reason that the technologies used to make chrome extensions were the exact ones used to make websites, i mean it makes sense but when i heard the term 'extension' i thought that it would feature a different set of tools. 

I also had to learn Javascript for making the extension and how to use it in conjunction with API's, which helped me gain an appreciation for the elegance of the DOM structure that websites follow.
