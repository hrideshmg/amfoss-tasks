## Poke Search
This was a pretty fun task, it was the first time i was working with code which had been written by someone else, and it was a good experience to figure out what exactly was written there, find ways to customize it and extend its functionality. I was also surprised by the depth of the pokemon API, but using postman made it a bit easier to write the queries that i wanted to do.
