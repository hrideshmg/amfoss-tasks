This was by far one of the most fun tasks ive done, while i did have some very minor experience creating a small discord bot, this was the first time i combined two different fields, namely - web scraping and discord bots into a singular application. 

I spent a lot of time just reading the discord.py documentation and exploring the different commands featured there, this also made me comfortable with building an application while referring to the docs rather than rely on websites or youtube tutorials.
