## Vim
I've always wanted to learn vim, so this was a great opportunity to dip my toes in it. In fact, im writing this readme using vim! Vimtutor took me around 2 hours to complete but it was completely worth it, i didnt try to memorize everything (as they recommended) rather i will try to learn more from using, it will be interesting to see how this new tool will speed up my workflow.
