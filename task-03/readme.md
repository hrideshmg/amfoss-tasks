# Hello World
This task was quite informative, it helped me roughly explore the different programming languages out there and made me realize how similar a lot of them are.
 
While i could get by from just reading the documentation for most of the languages listed, i hit a sort of roadblock when i started Haskell, thats when i was introduced 
to the purely functional programming language paradigm, the absence of loops meant that i had to rework the algorithm i was using and create a new one which made use of 
recursion. It almost felt like i was learning programming from scratch all over again with Haskell but the experience was quite worthwhile.
