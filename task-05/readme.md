## Hypertext Mockup Language
Pretty straightforward task but it was surprisingly frustrating to figure out how css positioning works, but towards the end I did get the hang of it. While im not a huge fan of front end development, it was insightful to learn how exactly css works together with html. I've always seen divs and spans when using the inspect tool, but only now do i truly understand what exactly they are used for. While the task was quite frustrating, im quite proud of the end result and atleast now i understand those memes about the difficulty in centering divs xD.
